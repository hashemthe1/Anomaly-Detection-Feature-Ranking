# Anomaly Detection Feature Ranking

This repository contains Python code for anomaly detection using accelerometer data. Features are extracted from time-domain and frequency-domain, and a Random Forest classifier is used for feature importance ranking.

## Files:
- `anomaly_detection_feature_ranking_rf.py`: Main code for feature extraction, ranking, and visualization.
  
## How to Run:
1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python anomaly_detection_feature_ranking_rf.py
    ```

## Features:
- Time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction.
- Random Forest-based feature importance ranking.
- Visualization of accelerometer data and frequency spectra.
